# Inference and Computer Vision at the Edge
A getting started guide to deploying machine learning models, deep learning models, and computer vision at the Edge with ADLINK Hardware.

This repository uses the leading inference engines from Intel and NVIDIA to deploy optimized solutions.

# Hello World
Almost every technology provides the proverbial Hello World example to get users familiar. And we will be no different except that since we working with AI and Computer Vision technologies our Hello World will be an image classifier.

## Hello World with NVIDIA
The `Hello World` example builds a real-time image classifier using Python and can be run on any platform that supports GPU accelerated TensorFlow.

## Hello World with OpenVINO
The `Hello World` example builds a real-time image classifier using Python and can be run on any platform that supports the Intel Distribution of OpenVINO.
